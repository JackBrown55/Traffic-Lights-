This code was written for an Arduino nano, and using the standard Arduino IDE.

I will not be providing the exact description of the project that we were assigned, in order to prevent future 
students from knowing whether or not it works for their specific project. 

This is a system that counts the number of cars in the segmnent of the road blocked off for construction, and 
based on that status, adds or subtracts time from a predetermined clock, such that cars aren't likely to 
collide, and all cars are out of that segment travelling in one direction before more are let in from the 
other side. 

This was made with the help of my three teammates, Beth Hailstone, Liam Legge and Kai Le.
